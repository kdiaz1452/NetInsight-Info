# NetInsight-Info

NetInsight is a user-friendly desktop application designed to simplify network configuration and diagnostics using a graphical interface. It provides tools for displaying network information, managing firewall rules, performing subnet calculations, and more. The app is designed to assist users in analyzing their own network settings, ensuring privacy and security.

### Why the Source Code is Private

Out of concern for potential misuse of the app's functionalities (such as port scanning and other network-related tools), I have made the decision to keep the source code private. This ensures that the app can remain a helpful tool for responsible users while protecting it from being used maliciously.

If you have questions, suggestions, or would like to learn more about how the app works, please feel free to post in the **Discussions** section of this repository. I will respond to all inquiries and keep you updated on any future releases.
